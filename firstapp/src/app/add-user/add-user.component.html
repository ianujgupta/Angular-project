<!--
  ngSubmit is the event and we are hooking our addUser method to
   this event so that on submit addUser method will get executed
   
   myform is a template variable, it contains formgroup 
   and we are passing this to our method so as to process it at code(ts) side  
-->
<form #myform = ngForm (ngSubmit)="addUser(myform)">
<!--ngModel creates formcontrol at code side,
         without mentioning ngModel, angular has no knoledge of this textfield -->
    <label>username</label>
    <input typw="text" name="username" ngModel>

    <label>age</label>
    <input type="number" name="age" ngModel >
